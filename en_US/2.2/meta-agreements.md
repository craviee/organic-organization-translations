## 1. Preface

**Organic Organization (O2)** is a catalyst that helps organizations and their subparts (teams, departaments, units) to adopt self-management. O2 is composed of its **Meta-Agreements** decribed in this document, besides an ever evolving [Pattern Library](https://targetteal.com/en/o2/library/).

All participants of an **Organic Organization**, its _Partners_, may rely on the **Meta-Agreements** here presented and also agree to be bound by them.

> ¹ Meta-Agreements are agreements about how to build new agreements

## 2. Organizational Structure

**Organic Organizations** have an _Organizational Structure_ composed of _Roles_, _Circles_, and _Restrictions_, which define expectations and limitations of authority. These elements form a hierarchy of _Circles_ and are described in details in the upcoming sections.

### 2.1 Roles

_Partners_ of the organization normally perform the work in one or more explicitly defined _Roles_.

A _Role_ is an element of the _Organizational Structure_ composed of:

- A descriptive name (mandatory);
- A _Purpose_, which is a capacity, potential or unattainable goal that the _Role_ is going to pursue or express (mandatory);
- _Accountabilities_, which are ongoing activities that others can expect the _Role_ to perform (optional);
- _Artifacts_, which are things the _Role_ can exclusively control and regulate for the organization (optional).

### 2.2 Circles

_Circles_ are analogous structures to _Roles_, and thus have the same properties described in the [Roles](#roles) section.

_Circles_ can contain _Roles_ and inner _Circles_, which can further contain their own _Roles_ and inner _Circles_, and so on. The structure is fractal. From the perspective of an outer _Circle_, its inner _Circles_ are like _Roles_ that have the additional ability to break themselves down.

_Circle_ properties (name, _Purpose_, _Accountabilities_, and _Artifacts_) can only be changed in the _Adapt Mode_ of the _Circle Meeting_ that contains the _Circle_.

An _Artifact_ of a _Circle_ can be accessed by all _Circle Members_, except if the _Artifact_ has been further delegated to a specific _Role_ or inner _Circle_ in that same  _Circle_.

The organization itself is the broader _Circle_ in structure, containing all other ones.

Inner _Circles_ are created for the purpose of keeping _Circle Meetings_ with a manageable number of participants and clear focus.

The _Circle Members_ of a given _Circle_ include all _Partners_ that:
 - Fill at least one _Role_ in the _Circle_;
 - Fill the _Outer Link_ _Role_ in at least one inner _Circle_;
 - Fill the _Inner Link_ _Role_ in at least one inner _Circle_;

### 2.3 Restrictions

_Restrictions_ are limitations of authority that apply to all _Roles_ of a given _Circle_. _Restrictions_ are composed of a title and description (both mandatory) and propagate to all inner _Circles_, unless otherwise specified in their description.

_Restrictions_ can't establish expectations, because that's the purpose of an _Accountability_. Nevertheless, a _Restriction_ can demmand action, but only for the individuals on which the _Restriction_ applies and in the specific condition that triggers it.

### 2.4 Structure Evolution

All elements that are part of the _Circle_ _Organizational Structure_ described in this section (_Roles_, _Circles_, and _Restrictions_) can only be changed in the _Adapt Mode_ of its _Circle Meeting_.

## 3. Rights

_Partners_ of the organization have two basic rights described in this section:

### 3.1 No implicit expectations

_Partners_ may deny requests if there's no matching explicit _Accountability_ in the description of the _Role_ being requested. However, _Partners_ must always accept requests that make sense to their _Role_'s _Purpose_, even if no explicit _Accountability_ is recorded.

### 3.2 Authority to act

While pursuing the _Purpose_ of one of their _Roles_, _Partners_ of the organization are always authorized to take action, unless an _Artifact_ or _Restriction_ says otherwise.

## 4. Duties

_Partners_ of the organization have some duties towards one another:

### 4.1 Expressing Roles

Each _Partner_ is responsible for monitoring how the _Purpose_ and _Accountabilities_ of each of their _Roles_ are being expressed, and comparing that with their vision of ideal potential expression. _Partners_ also have to identify gaps between the current reality and a potential they sense, each one being a _Tension_.

_Partners_ are responsible for trying to resolve those _Tensions_, using the authorities and other mechanisms provided by these **Meta-Agreements**.  

### 4.2 Transparency

When requested, it's expected that _Partners_ share all relevant information about the work of their _Roles_, including each project they're working on, actions identified, prioritization criteria and relevant metrics.

Upon request, it's also expected that _Partners_ give estimations and projections about possible completion dates of their works, even those projections shall not be considered deadlines or committments.

### 4.3 Prioritization

It's expected that _Partners_ prioritize their work in alignment with _Circle_ priorities defined by the _Outer Link_, or by other process that sets priorities.

### 4.4 Circle Meetings

When requested by other _Circle Members_, _Partners_ must prioritize attending to _Circle Meetings_ instead of working on their _Roles_.

## 5. Circle Meetings

_Circle Members_ regularly gather in a space called _Circle Meeting_ to perform one or more of the 5 special meeting modes described in the following section: _Review_, _Sync_, _Adapt_, _Select_, and _Care_.

_Circle Meetings_ are scheduled by the _Secretary_ and facilitated by the _Facilitator_, two _Core Roles_ described at the end of this document.

People that aren't _Circle Members_ are not authorized to process _Tensions_ in _Circle Meetings_, unless they are invited by a _Circle Member_ in order to help in the processing of a specific _Tension_.  

### 5.1 Meeting Format

_Circle Meetings_ start with a check-in round, where one at a time, each participant shares how he or she is comming to the meeting.

The _Facilitator_ fills the meeting with one or more of the 5 modes, according to the time available and the needs of the _Circle_. The _Facilitator_ should declare the name, goal, and clarify any rules of each mode before starting it.

_Circle Meetings_ end with a closing round, where one at a time, each participant shares a final reflection about the meeting.

### 5.2 Tension List

The different meeting modes are used to process specific _Tensions_ sensed by the participants. Specially before _Sync_ and _Adapt_, the _Facilitator_ must ask for the _Secretary_ to build a _Tension_ list to process. Each person feeling a _Tension_ must name it using two or three words aloud. The _Secretary_ than records the name of the _Tension_, along with the name of the participant. The _Facilitator_ should not give space or allow the participants to explain the _Tensions_ during the process of building the list.

After the _Tension_ list is built, the _Facilitator_ must focus on one _Tension_ at a time. That means the _Facilitator_ should not allow other participants to try to include their perspectives in the _Tension_ being processed, unless the participant who originally felt the _Tension_ believes that perspective is useful.

### 5.3 Review Mode

The goal of the _Review Mode_ is to give transparency about the work of the _Circle_.

It's up to the _Facilitator_ to decide how specifically the _Review Mode_ is conducted, except if a _Restriction_ determines otherwise.

Detailed suggestions can be found in the **Pattern Library**.

### 5.4 Sync Mode

The goal of the _Sync Mode_ is to quickly process _Tensions_ that don't require the _Circle_ to update its _Organizational Structure_. Typical outputs of the _Sync Mode_ include actions, projects, help requests, and information sharing.

After the _Tension_ list is built, the _Facilitator_ must go through it and process one at a time, trying to help the person who brought the _Tension_ to get what he or she needs.

The _Facilitator_ must simply allow who brought the _Tension_ to engage others in their _Roles_ and duties, until a path for solving the _Tension_ has been identified.

The _Facilitator_ must allow time for the processing of each _Tension_ on the list within the _Sync Mode_, and for achieving that may cut off the processing of any _Tension_ that is taking more than its due share of the remaining time.

The _Secretary_ then records the requests accepted by other participants.

The format of the _Sync Mode_ can be changed entirely with a _Restriction_, provided that the original goal is maintained.

### 5.5 Adapt Mode

The goal of the _Adapt Mode_ is to process _Tensions_ into _Organizational Structure_ changes. Those changes may include:

- Adding, removing or modifying _Circle_ _Roles_;
- Adding, removing or modifying inner _Circles_ (only their properties);
- Adding, removing or modifyng _Circle_ _Restrictions_;

After the _Tension_ list is built, the _Facilitator_ must guide the resolution of each _Tension_ using the _Integrative Decision-Making_.

#### 5.5.1 Integrative Decision-Making

The _Integrative Decision-Making_ contains the following elements:

1. **Presentation.** The participant who brought the _Tension_ (the proponent) should be able to present a proposal to solve it. Alternatively, the _Facilitator_ may allow the proponent to seek help from others to craft a proposal. If that is the case, the _Facilitator_ should not allow any consensus building process. The goal is to solve the proponent's _Tension_, not to satisfy everyone.
2. **Questions.** The participants can ask questions to the proponent with the goal of better understanding the _Tension_ or the proposal being presented.
3. **Reactions.** Each participant also may share a reaction or opinion about the proposal.
4. **Alteration.** After hearing reactions and questions, the proponent may change the proposal.  
5. **Objections.** Each participant may raise one or more _Objections_ to the proposal.
6. **Integration.** If there are _Objections_, they should be integrated to the proposal, one at a time. The goal is to modify the proposal so that it solves the original _Tension_, but without causing the raised _Objection_. If the proposal is changed, the _Facilitator_ must give the participants another opportunity to raise _Objections_. If a proposal is taking too much time to integrate, the _Facilitator_ may discard the proposal entirely in order to pass to the next item on the _Tension_ list.

It's up to the _Facilitator_ to decide how or in what order the elements above are presented. Other elements or steps may be added, as long as they do not collide with the minimum elements.

#### 5.5.2 Only proposals based on examples

The proponent must be able to explain and give an example of a past or present situation where each part of the crafted proposal would solve or reduce the _Tension_.

If the _Facilitator_ considers the proponent wasn't able to present the required examples and clarifications, the _Facilitator_ should discard the proposal. However, the _Facilitator_ must not judge the accuracy of the arguments presented, but only if they were presented with logical reasoning and are thus reasonable.

#### 5.5.3 Only changes to the Organizational Structure

To be valid output for the _Adapt Mode_, a proposal must be composed only of changes to the _Circle_ _Organizational Structure_. If that is not the case, any participant can raise a _Meta-Agreements Violation Objection_.

#### 5.5.4 Objections

An _Objection_ is a reason why the proposal would cause harm and move the _Circle_ backwards. The _Facilitator_ may ask questions to help the objector understand if his or her _Objections_ are valid or not. An _Objection_ is considered valid if the objector understands that it meets all the 4 following criteria:

1. **Degradation**. An _Objection_ is a harm that the proposal may cause to the _Circle_. This harm must be explained.
2. **Causality**. This harm is caused by the proposal, that is, it doesn't exist without it.
3. **Data-based**. The _Objection_ is based on current data or past experiences. In other words, it's not an anticipation of future events. However, if the alleged harm is so disastrous that the _Circle_ wouldn't be able to adapt in the future, this criteria can be disconsidered.
4. **Role-related**. The _Objection_ affects one of the objector _Roles_ in the _Circle_.

When validating _Objections_, the _Facilitator_ must not judge the accuracy of the arguments presented, but only if they were presented with logical reasoning and are thus reasonable. Valid _Objections_ are moved to integration.

#### 5.5.5 Meta-Agreements Violation Objection

Any participant may raise a _Meta-Agreements Violation Objection_ if he or she considers the proposal violates one of the rules described in this document. For example, one can say the proposal is not a valid output for the _Adapt Mode_. This special _Objection_ doesn't need to be validated using the criteria described in this section, but it should be integrated normally.

#### 5.5.6 Asynchronous Proposals

Changes to the _Circle_ _Organizational Structure_ can be proposed outside _Circle Meetings_ and are automatically approved if all _Circle Members_ declare that they have no _Objections_. If any _Objection_ are raised, the proposal should be escalated to the _Adapt Mode_ of a conventional _Circle Meeting_.

It's up to the _Secretary_ to define how this process is accomplished.

### 5.6 Select Mode

The goal of the _Select Mode_ is to choose _Circle Members_ to fill the 3 elected _Core Roles_: _Facilitator_, _Secretary_, and _Inner Link_.

Any _Circle Member_ can ask the _Facilitator_ to jump to the _Select Mode_ and perform an election to one or more of the elected _Core Roles_. If that is the case, this should be done immediately.

The election process of the 3 elected _Core Roles_ should only be done inside a _Circle Meeting_.

The _Facilitator_ must facilitate an election process considering the following rules:

- All and only _Circle Members_ are eligible to the 3 elected _Core Roles_, with the exception of the person filling the _Outer Link_ _Role_, who is not eligible as _Facilitator_ or _Inner Link_ of the same _Circle_.
- If there is a tie, the _Facilitator_ can choose one of the following criteria to untie:
 - The person who named himself or herself, if only one of the tied candidates has;
 - The person who is already filling the _Role_, if only one of the tied candidates is;
 - Randomly choose any of the tied candidates.

For examples of election processes for the _Select Mode_, check the **Pattern Library**.

The format of the _Select Mode_ can be further limited using a _Restriction_, provided that the original goal is maintained and the rules above are met.

### 5.7 Care Mode

The goal of the _Care Mode_ is to take care of the tribal space and nurture the quality of relationships between _Circle Members_. The _Facilitator_ is free to decide how to best use it.

This mode should not be used to make changes to the _Circle_ _Organizational Structure_ or engage the _Circle Members_ in their _Roles_ and duties.

## 6. Core Roles

Each _Circle_ has 4 _Core Roles_ that are automatically created: _Outer Link_, _Inner Link_, _Facilitator_, and _Secretary_.

The _Facilitator_ and the _Secretary_ are elected in the _Select Mode_ and operate mainly inside the _Circle Meetings_.

The _Outer Link_ and the _Inner Link_ are used to exchange messages and ease the communication between _Circle_ and outer _Circle_, specially during _Circle Meetings_.

The _Core Roles_ of each _Circle_ can be changed during the _Adapt Mode_. Nevertheless, the following restrictions apply:

- The _Purpose_ of the _Core Roles_ cannot be changed;
- New _Accountabilities_ and _Artifacts_ cannot be added to the _Outer Link_ _Role_;
- The initial _Outer Link_ _Role_ _Accountabilities_ and _Artifacts_ can be modified or removed entirely, as long as they are delegated to another _Role_ or process in the _Circle_;
- The initial _Accountabilities_ and _Artifacts_ of the _Facilitator_, _Secretary_, and _Inner Link_ cannot be removed or modified.

Changes made to the _Core Roles_ of a _Circle_ apply only to the _Circle_ where the modification took place, that is, they do not propagate to the inner _Circles_.

### 6.1 Outer Link

The _Outer Link_ is chosen by the outer _Circle_, by any process that assigns people to _Roles_ in the outer _Circle_.

The _Outer Link_ is responsible for assigning people to the _Roles_ in the _Circle_ and may invite any person who is part of the organization, unless a _Restriction_ says otherwise.

The _Outer Link_ holds all _Circle_ undelegated _Accountabilities_ and _Artifacts_.
