# Introduction

Welcome to the beautiful world of O²! The age of organizations-as-engines is ending. This mechanistic view of the world is becoming obsolete, as current ways of managing work makes companies unable to adapt to the VUCA world. 

Some of these organizations are adapting. Others will vanish in a few decades. Wherever your company might be, we've got good news! This guide will definitely help you install the O² catalyst in your environment. 

This guide aims to be a complete reference for change agents that want to seed new evolutionary social systems. Whether you have experience with change management, facilitation or org-design, it doesn't matter. What matters is that you believe the transformation is possible and that you are eager to try.

## Why we decided to create O²

We believe that the current approaches to create responsive, evolutionary and agile organizations are not enough. The Agile Manifesto, Reinventing Organizations, Holacracy, Sociocracy, and the Responsive Organizations movement are great influences for us. Still, we need more than that to create a significant change.

## What is O²?

O² is a self-organization catalyst. Think it like a game that you can start to play at work. Like all games, people need to respect and believe in the rules in order for it to be playable. Maybe that is the greatest challenge to practice O² in your organization, team or department. You have to convince people to at least try this new system. We are going to discuss more ways of seeding O² in chapter X.

O² is composed of three books. The first one is the Game Book, containing all the necessary and mandatory rules to minimally practice O². It's intended to be a reference of rules, not a guide.

The second book is the Pattern Book. The rules contained in the Game Book are a great start, but they are not all there is. To evolve your organization to the next level, you probably will need a more detailed reference of how to tackle some specific issues that may arise in your journey. The Pattern Book is an extensive reference containing several patterns, practices, modifications and experiments to further advance your organization.

The third books is this one - The Rogue Book. This is an extensive and detailed implementation reference, containing much of our experience practicing O². We believe that current approaches to self-organization fail in this matter, for not providing enough open information for people that want to do by themselves.

## Who we are

We are consultants, facilitators, org-designers, culture hackers, and agile coaches. We are people helping organizations grow and nurture new social technologies that enable them to handle an ever increasing level of complexity.
