# Circle Meetings

Circle members regularly gather in a space called circle meeting in order to perform one or more of the 5 special functions described in the upcoming sections: review, sync, adapt, select, and care.

Circle members can invite people that are not members of the circle to solve particular issues or process tensions.

Circle meetings are scheduled by the circle's secretary and facilitated by the facilitator, two special roles described in the core roles section. 

## Circle meeting structure

Circle meetings start with a check in round and end with a check out round. The facilitator fills the meeting with one or more of the 5 different functions available, according to the time available and the needs of the circle. 

In the check in round, one at a time, each participant shares how he or she is coming to the meeting. 

In the check out round, one at a time, each participant shares a closing reflection about the meeting.

The facilitator should not allow any discussion or crosstalk in both rounds, in order to preserve the individual space of every circle member. 

The different functions should never be mixed together. The facilitator must state the name, goal, and clarify rules of each function before beginning to facilitate each one. 

## # Review Function

The goal of the review function is to give transparency about the circle's work. That is usually accomplished by reviewing metrics, recurring actions, and projects. 

It's up to the facilitator to decide how specifically the review function is conducted, except if a patch determines otherwise. 

Detailed suggestions can be found in the pattern book.

## # Sync Function

The goal of the sync function is to quickly process tensions into actions, projects, information requests and information sharing. 

The facilitator starts by asking the secretary to build a list of tensions to process. Each person feeling a tension must label it using two or three words aloud. The secretary then records the label, along with the name of the participant. 

The facilitator must not give any more space to allow the person to explain the tension during the process of building the list. 

After the tension list is built, the facilitator must go through the list and process one tension at a time, trying to help the item owner to get what he or she needs.

The facilitator must simply allow the list item owner to engage others in their roles and duties as desired, until a path for resolving the tension is identified.

The facilitator must attempt to allow time for processing every tension list item within the sync function, and in order to do so may cut off the processing of any item thatâ€™s taking more than its due share of the remaining time.

The secretary then records any requested projects and actions accepted by the participants. 

The sync function structure can be changed entirely with a patch, provided that the goal is maintained. 

## Adapt Function 

The goal of the adapt function is to process tensions into structural changes in the circle. These changes include:

- Adding, removing or changing circle roles;
- Adding, removing or changing sub-circles;
- Adding, removing or changing circle patches;
- Adding, removing or changing circle restrictions;

What can be done in the adapt function can only be done inside the adapt function. This means that you cannot add, remove or change the circle structure outside this function. Except for asynchronous proposals. 

The facilitator must ask the secretary to build a list of tensions to process, exactly as described in the sync function.

After the tension list is built, the facilitator must guide the resolution of each tension list item, using the following process guidelines:

- Quick proposal building
- One tension at a time
- Example-based proposals only
- Structural changes only
- Personal expression equivalence
- Integrative decision-making

### Quick proposal building

The tension list item owner should be able to present a proposal to solve his or her own tension in the process. 

Alternatively, the facilitator may allow the item owner to ask help from other participants to craft the proposal. If that is the case, the facilitator should not allow any consensus building process. The goal is to solve the item owner's tension, not to satisfy everyone.

### One tension at a time

The tensions should be processed one at a time. This means that the facilitator should not allow other participants to try to include their perspectives and/or tensions in the current proposal, unless the item owner deems those perspectives are useful to solve his or her own tension.

### Example-based proposals only

The item owner must explain the tension and give an example about a past or present situation where each part of the crafted proposal would solve or reduce the tension. That is mandatory.

If the facilitator deems that the item owner has failed to present the required example and explanations, the facilitator must discard the proposal. Nevertheless, the facilitator should not judge the accuracy of the arguments presented, but only if they were presented with a logical reasoning and are thus reasonable.

### Structural changes only

To be a valid output for the adapt function, the proposal should be composed only of structural changes. If that is not the case, any participant can raise a Game Book violation objection.

### Personal expression equivalence

Each participant of the circle should have the same space and the option to ask questions or express his or her opinion during the execution of the adapt function. How exactly this space is made available is up to the facilitator.

### Integrative decision-making

The facilitator must use an integrative decision-making process to facilitate the resolution of each tension. That means that any participant must be allowed to raise one or more objections to the proposal. 

If no objections are raised, the proposal is accepted. 

If there are objections, they must be integrated to the proposal.

#### Objections

An objection is a reason why the proposal would cause harm to the circle and move it backwards. The facilitator can ask questions to help the objector understand if his or her objection is valid. These questions must evaluate:

1. **Degradation**. The objection is about some harm that the proposal would cause to the circle. This harm must be explained.
2. **Causality**. The objection must be caused by the proposal in order to be valid.
3. **Data-based**. The objection is based on current data or past experience. In other words, it's not an anticipation of future events. However, if the claimed harm is so disastrous that the circle would not be able to adapt in the future, then the objection can be predictive and this criteria can be disconsidered.
4. **Role-related**. The objection affects one of the objector roles in the circle. 

When validating objections, the facilitator should not judge the accuracy of the arguments presented, but only if they were presented with a logical reasoning and are thus reasonable. Valid objections are moved to integration.

#### Game Book violation objection

Any participant can raise a "Game Book violation objection" if he or she deems the proposal violates one of the rules described in this Game Book. For example, one might say that a proposal is not a valid output for the adapt function.

In this case, the facilitator can ask the secretary to decide whether this is true or not. This special objection does not need to be validated using the criteria described in this section. Game Book violation objections must be integrated normally.

### Integration

After harvesting valid objections, the facilitator must guide their integration to the proposal. One objection should be integrated at a time. The goal is to craft an amended proposal that would solve the original tension without causing the objection.

If the proposal is amended, the facilitator must give another opportunity to the participants to raise objections. 

If a proposal is taking too much time to integrate, the facilitator can discard the proposal entirely in order to move to the next tension list item. 

### Asynchronous Proposals

Structural changes can be proposed outside circle meetings and are automatically adopted if all circle members declare that they don't have any objections. If any objections are raised, the proposal must be escalated to the adapt function of a circle meeting.

It's up to the secretary to define how this process is accomplished. 

## Select Function

The goal of the select function is to select circle members to fill the three structural roles: facilitador, secretary and internal link. 

Anyone in the circle can ask for the facilitator to jump to the select function and perform an election for one of the three elected roles. If that is the case, this should be done immediately.

The process of electing the three structural roles must be done only inside a circle meeting.

The facilitator must facilitate an election process, considering the following rules:

- Every member of the circle is eligible for all three roles, with the exception of the person who fills the external link function, which is not eligible as facilitator or internal link.
- If there is a tie, the facilitator can chose one of the following criteria to untie:
  - The person who named him or herself, if only one of the tied candidates has;
  - The person who is already filling the role, if only one of the tied candidates is;
  - Random;
- The person who fills the external link role cannot be elected as facilitator or internal link of the same circle. 
- Only circle members are eligible as facilitator, secretary or internal link.

For examples of election processes for the select function, see the Pattern Book.

The structure of the select function can be restricted using a patch, provided that the goal is maintained and the rules above are followed.

## Care Function

The goal of this function is to care for the tribal space, and nurture the quality of relationships between circle members. The format is open for the facilitator to decide how to use.

This space should not be used to make changes to the structure of the circle or ask projects and actions from other circle members.
