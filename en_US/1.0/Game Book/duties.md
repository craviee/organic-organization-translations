# Duties

As member of the organization, team or department that is practicing OÂ², you have some special duties towards all other members. 

## Expressing roles

You are responsible for monitoring how your role purpose and accountabilities are expressed, and comparing that to your vision of their ideal potential expression. You should identify those gaps between the current reality and a potential you sense, each one being a tension. 
You are also responsible for trying to resolve those tensions by using the authorities and other mechanisms available to you under the Game Book.

## Transparency

When requested, you are expected to share all relevant information about your roles' work, including each project you are working on, actions identified, prioritization criteria and relevant metrics.
Upon request, you are also expected to give estimates and projections about possible completion dates of projects and actions, even though those projections shall not be considered deadlines or commitments. 

## Prioritization

You are expected to prioritize your work in alignment with circle priorities defined by the External Link, or any other process that sets priorities. 

## Circle meetings

When requested by other circle members, you should prioritize attending to the circle meetings over working on your roles' project and actions.
