# Basic Elements

## Roles

Members of the organization will typically perform work for the organization in one or more explicitly defined roles.
A role is a part of the organization composed of:
- A descriptive name (mandatory);
- A purpose, which is the never ending goal of the role (mandatory);
- Accountabilities, which are recurring activities that others can expect the role will perform (optional);
- Domains, which are things that the role can exclusively control and regulate for the organization (optional).
Roles can only be changed in the adapt function of its circle meeting.

## Circles

Circles are analogous structures to roles, and thus have the same properties described in the role section.
Circles can contain roles and inner circles, that can contain their own roles and inner circles, and so on. The structure is fractal. From the perspective of an outer circle, its inner circles are like roles that have the additional ability to break themselves down. 
Circles are composed of roles and inner circles, not people. You are a member of the circle if you fill a role in that same circle. 
Inner circle properties (name, purpose, accountabilities, and domains) can only be changed in the adapt function of its outer circle meeting.
A circle domain can be accessed by all circle members, except if it has been delegated to a specific role in that circle. 
The organization itself is the broadest circle in the structure, containing all other ones.
Inner circles are created for the purpose of maintaining the circle meetings with a manageable number of people and clear focus.  

## Restrictions

Restrictions are limitations of authority that apply to all roles of a given circle. 
Restrictions are composed of a title and a description (both mandatory). 
Restrictions cascade to all inner circles, unless otherwise specified in the description.
Restrictions cannot set expectations, because that is the goal of an accountability (property of a role or circle). Nevertheless, a restriction may demand action, but only for the person(s) or role(s) to which the restriction applies in the specific condition that triggers it.
Restrictions can only be adopted inside circle meetings, more specifically in the adapt function.

## Patches

Some sections of this game book explicitly allow modifications. When this is the case, you can change that rule with a patch. 
The patch follows the same structure of the restriction (title and description) and can only be adopted inside circle meetings, in the adapt function. 
Patches cascade to all inner circles, unless otherwise specified in the description.
