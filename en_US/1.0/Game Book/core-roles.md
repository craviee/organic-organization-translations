# Core Roles

Every circle has 4 core roles automatically created: external link, internal link, facilitator, and secretary.

The facilitator and the secretary are elected in the select function and operate mainly inside circle meetings.

The external link and internal link are used to exchange messages and facilitate communication between circle and external circle, specially during circle meetings.

## External Link

The External Link is chosen by the external circle, by whatever process that assigns people to roles in the external circle. 

The External Link is accountable for assigning people to roles in the circle, and may invite any person that is part of the organization, unless a restriction says otherwise.

The External Link can also establish priorities for the circle, and circle members are expected to align with those priorities. 

The External Link role can be excluded or modified entirely with a patch.

The External Link holds all circle un-delegated domains and accountabilities.
