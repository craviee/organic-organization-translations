# Introduction: Organic Organization

Organic Organization, or O² for short, is a self-organization catalyst composed of three books. O² describes how to foster self-management in team, department or organization. 

The work is still in progress, yet we already have a release of the Game Book available here. 

Translations are available in [another github project](https://github.com/targetteal/organic-organization-translations).

Our influences include:
- Reinventing Organizations
- Holacracy and Sociocracy 3.0
- Agile Software Development
